    Exercise 3
    
    We have defined two variables for you above, num1 and num2
    
    1. Declare a variable named "sum" that contains the sum of num1 and num2
    2. Declare a variable named "subtract" that contains the result of num1 minus num2
    3. Declare a variable named "multiply" that contains the result of num1 multiplied by num2
    4. Declare a variable named "divide" that contains the result of num1 divided by num2
    5. Then, log each of these variables to the console.

    You can use `let` or `const` to define these variables, it's up to you!
