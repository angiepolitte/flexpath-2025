## Exercise overview

Now that you have the basics of JavaScript and working with JavaScript in the web
down, we wanted to revisit some fundamental concepts and give you a deeper understanding
of how to use them effectively in your programs.

These exercises will take a closer look at functions in JavaScript.


## Getting Started


1. Using Visual Studio Code, open the folder `flexpath-revisit-functions-exercises` 
   wherever you saved it on your device. 
2. Then open the `flexpath-revisit-functions-exercises/exercise` folder. 
   Inside are a collection of folders for each exercise. Exercise instructions are 
   provided to you in .txt files in these folders.
3. To test your code, you will open up your terminal, and navigate to the specific `exercise_[number]`
   folder inside of the larger `exercises/` folder where you are working in, using the
   change directory command `cd`.
4. You will then run the command `node [filename].js` to run whichever file
   in the folder you are working with, replacing `[filename]` in the command
   with the file's actual name.

Exercise solutions are in the `/solution` folder

We have also included a list of challenge problems for you to work with on 
your own in the future. THIS LIST IS OPTIONAL and is not required to graduate
from the Flex Path course. 

More details are available inside the `OPTIONAL-challenge-problems-for-later`
folder.

**Note**:

For the first few exercises in this repository, we have included example 
JS code you can use to test your solutions.

But, after the first few exercises we don't provide it anymore.

As a Software Developer, you will have to both solve a problem given to you and 
come up with code on your own to test that your solution to that problem actually works. 

This is an important skill to build, and it is vital to being able to do this job.

Therefore, we want you to start getting comfortable writing JavaScript code to 
test that your solutions work as intended.

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Function Declarations and Expressions**:
    
    - How to define functions using declarations and expressions.
    - Differences between the two, including hoisting behavior.
2. **Arrow Functions**:
    
    - Syntax and differences from traditional function expressions.
    - Limitations of arrow functions, like the lack of `this` binding.
3. **Function Constructor**:
    
    - Using the `Function` constructor to create functions dynamically.
4. **Recursion**:
    
    - Understanding recursive functions and the importance of base cases.
5. **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**:
    
    - Syntax and use cases for self-executing functions.
6. **Function Parameters**:
    
    - Differentiating between parameters and arguments.
    - Concepts of pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.
    - Using default parameters for safer function calls.
    - Understanding and using the `arguments` object.
    - Using rest parameters to handle an indefinite number of arguments.
7. **Passing Functions as Arguments (Callbacks)**:
    
    - Creating higher-order functions that accept other functions as arguments.
    - Common use cases, like asynchronous programming with `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
8. **Function Scope and Closures**:
    
    - How variable scope works in JavaScript.
    - Understanding closures and how inner functions retain access to outer variables.
9. **The `this` Keyword**:
    
    - How `this` behaves in different contexts (global, function, and method).
    - Differences in `this` behavior in arrow functions.
    - Using `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` to control `this`.
