Explanation:

In the incorrect version, the variable i is declared with var, 
which is function-scoped. 

By the time the callbacks execute, i has become 6.

Wrapping setTimeout in an IIFE captures the current value of i as num, 
creating a new scope.

Alternatively, using let declares i with block scope, preserving its value 
within each iteration.
