Explanation:

`call` invokes the function immediately with `this` set to `user` and 
arguments passed individually.

`apply` is similar to `call` but arguments are passed as an array.

`bind` returns a new function with `this` bound to `user`, 
which can be called later.

These methods are used to control the value of `this` in function invocations.
