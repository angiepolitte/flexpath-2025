Explanation:

In `regularFunction`, `this` refers to person because it's called 
as a method of person.

In `arrowFunction`, `this` does not bind to person; 
it inherits `this` from the enclosing scope, which is the global scope where 
this.name is undefined.

Arrow functions are not suitable as object methods when 
this binding is required.
