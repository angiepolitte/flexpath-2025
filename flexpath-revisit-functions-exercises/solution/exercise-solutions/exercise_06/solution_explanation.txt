Explanation:

Primitives like numbers are passed by value. 
Modifications inside the function do not affect the original variable.

Objects are passed by reference. 
Changes to the object's properties inside the function 
affect the original object.

In the function, num is a copy of myNum, while obj 
references the same object as myObj.
