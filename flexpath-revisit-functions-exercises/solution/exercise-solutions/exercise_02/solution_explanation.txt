Explanation:

In `incrementTraditional`, this refers to the `calculator` object because 
it's called as a method of the object.

In `incrementArrow`, this is inherited from the enclosing scope, which is 
the global scope in this case. 

Since this.currentValue is undefined in the global scope, 
attempting to increment it results in NaN.

Arrow functions do not have their own this binding; 
they capture this from the surrounding context.
