Explanation:

The Function constructor creates a new function with the 
specified parameters and body.

It takes any number of string arguments: the last one is 
the function body, and the preceding ones are parameter names.

This method of function creation is similar to using `eval` and should be 
used cautiously due to potential security risks and performance issues.
