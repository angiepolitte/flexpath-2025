# flexpath-js-and-the-dom-exercises

## Exercise overview

The intention of this exercise is to give you more experience manipulating 
the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage using JavaScript.

## Getting Started


1. Using Visual Studio Code, open the folder `flexpath-js-and-the-dom-exercises` 
   wherever you saved it on your device. 
2. Then open the `flexpath-js-and-the-dom-exercises/exercise` folder. 
   Inside is a file named `index.html`. Open this file in your web browser
   using the methods shown in `flexpath-html-and-css-in-depth-exercises`.
3. You will write your JavaScript code in `exercise.js`. Any time you make a 
   change, save the file and then refresh the webpage displaying your .html web
   page in the browser.

   We have included a video `js-and-the-dom.mp4` showing how to do this.

   Exercise instructions are provided to you as code comments in the `exercises.js`
   file.

VIDEO DISCLAIMER - You will need to clone the repo to your local device before
you can watch the .mp4 file since GitHub does not support watching it from here.

Exercise solutions are in the `/solution` folder

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation**:
    
    - Accessing and modifying elements using methods like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`.
    - Navigating the DOM tree using properties like `parentNode`, `childNodes`, `firstChild`, and `lastChild`.
    - Updating the content and attributes of elements using `innerHTML`, `textContent`, and `setAttribute`.
2. **Event Handling**:
    
    - Adding event listeners with `addEventListener` and removing them with `removeEventListener`.
    - Handling various events such as clicks, mouse movements, and key presses.
    - Understanding event propagation, event bubbling, and stopping event propagation.
3. **Debugging and Performance**:
    
    - Using `console.log` for debugging.
    - Understanding the performance impact of certain DOM manipulations and optimizing code.
4. **Advanced DOM Manipulations**:
    
    - Creating and appending new elements using `createElement` and `appendChild`.
    - Removing elements from the DOM with `remove`.
    - Using class manipulation methods like `classList.add`, `classList.remove`, and `classList.toggle`.
5. **Preventing Default Behaviors**:
    
    - Preventing default actions of HTML elements using `preventDefault`.
6. **Drag and Drop Functionality**:
    
    - Implementing basic drag and drop features with event listeners for `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop`.
    - Using `dataTransfer` to pass data between drag and drop events.
