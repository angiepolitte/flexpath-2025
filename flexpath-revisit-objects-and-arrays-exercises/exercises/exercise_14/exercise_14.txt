Exercise 14: Implementing Inheritance with Prototypes

Problem:

Implement a simple class hierarchy without using ES6 classes. 

Create a `Shape` constructor function with a method 'area' that returns 0. 

Then, create a `Rectangle` constructor that inherits from `Shape` and 
overrides the 'area' method to compute the area of a rectangle.
