## Exercise overview

Now that you have the basics of JavaScript and working with JavaScript in the web
down, we wanted to revisit some fundamental concepts and give you a deeper understanding
of how to use them effectively in your programs.

These exercises will take a closer look at objects and arrays in JavaScript.


## Getting Started


1. Using Visual Studio Code, open the folder `flexpath-revisit-objects-and-arrays-exercises` 
   wherever you saved it on your device. 
2. Then open the `flexpath-revisit-objects-and-arrays-exercises/exercises` folder. 
   Inside are a collection of folders for each exercise. Exercise instructions are 
   provided to you in .txt files in these folders.
3. To test your code, you will open up your terminal, and navigate to the specific `exercise_[number]`
   folder inside of the larger `exercises/` folder where you are working in, using the
   change directory command `cd`.
4. You will then run the command `node [filename].js` to run whichever file
   in the folder you are working with, replacing `[filename]` in the command
   with the file's actual name.

Exercise solutions are in the `/solution` folder


**Note**:

For the first few exercises in this repository, we have included example 
JS code you can use to test your solutions.

But, after the first few exercises we don't provide it anymore.

As a Software Developer, you will have to both solve a problem given to you and 
come up with code on your own to test that your solution to that problem actually works. 

This is an important skill to build, and it is vital to being able to do this job.

Therefore, we want you to start getting comfortable writing JavaScript code to 
test that your solutions work as intended.

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Objects in JavaScript**:
    
    - Understanding what objects are and how they serve as containers for key-value pairs.
    - Creating objects using object literals and the `new` keyword.
    - Object properties and methods, including how to add, update, and delete properties.
    - Reference types vs. primitive types and the implications for memory management.
    - Using `Object.create` to define custom prototypes.
    - Understanding how JavaScript uses prototypes and the prototype chain.
2. **Array Manipulation**:
    
    - Creating arrays using literals and the `Array` constructor.
    - Adding and removing elements using `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift`.
    - Using `splice` and `slice` for modifying and extracting array elements.
    - Combining arrays with `concat` and the spread operator.
    - Cloning arrays and the concept of shallow vs. deep copying.
3. **Iteration Methods**:
    
    - Using `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for efficient array iteration and manipulation.
    - Understanding the power and use cases for these methods compared to traditional `for` loops.
4. **Prototypes and Inheritance**:
    
    - How objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.
    - The difference between object-oriented principles and JavaScriptâ€™s prototype-based inheritance.
    - The use of `Object.defineProperty` and property descriptors to control object properties.
5. **Advanced Topics**:
    
    - Memory management with stack and heap.
    - Concepts like object freezing with `Object.freeze` and sealing with `Object.seal`.
    - Enumerability, property attributes, and protecting object properties.
