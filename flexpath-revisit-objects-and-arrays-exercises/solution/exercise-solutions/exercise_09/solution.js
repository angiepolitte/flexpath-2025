	Exercise 9: Advanced Use of Array.reduce

	Problem:

	Given an array of transactions:
*/

const transactions = [
  { type: "deposit", amount: 100 },
  { type: "withdrawal", amount: 50 },
  { type: "deposit", amount: 200 },
  { type: "withdrawal", amount: 80 },
];

/*
	Use reduce to calculate the final balance, assuming the 
	starting balance is 0. 
	
	Also, categorize the transactions into deposits and withdrawals.
*/

const startingBalance = 0;

const result = transactions.reduce(
  (acc, transaction) => {
    if (transaction.type === "deposit") {
      acc.balance += transaction.amount;
      acc.deposits.push(transaction);
    } else if (transaction.type === "withdrawal") {
      acc.balance -= transaction.amount;
      acc.withdrawals.push(transaction);
    }
    return acc;
  },
  { balance: startingBalance, deposits: [], withdrawals: [] }
);

console.log("Final Balance:", result.balance); // Outputs: 170
console.log("Deposits:", result.deposits);
// Outputs:
// [{ type: 'deposit', amount: 100 },
//  { type: 'deposit', amount: 200 }]
console.log("Withdrawals:", result.withdrawals);
// Outputs:
// [{ type: 'withdrawal', amount: 50 },
//  { type: 'withdrawal', amount: 80 }]

/*
  Explanation:

  reduce is used to accumulate values into a single object.
  
  The accumulator acc contains the balance and categorized transactions.

  Each transaction updates the balance and the appropriate array.

  The initial value for reduce is an object with 
    starting balance and empty arrays.
