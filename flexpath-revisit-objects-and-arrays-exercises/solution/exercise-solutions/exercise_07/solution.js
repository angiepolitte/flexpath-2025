/*
	Exercise 7: Combining Arrays with Spread Operator
	Problem:

	Given two arrays:
*/

const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

/*
	Combine them into a single array combined using the spread operator. 
	Then, create a deep clone of combined and verify that modifying the 
	clone does not affect the original.
*/

const combined = [...array1, ...array2];
// combined is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

// Cloning combined
const clone = [...combined];

// Modifying clone
clone.push(7);

// Original remains unchanged
console.log(combined); // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
console.log(clone); // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

/*

	Explanation:

	The spread operator ... expands the elements of an array.
	Combining arrays with spread creates a new array.
	Cloning with spread creates a shallow copy.
	Since the array contains primitive values, shallow copy suffices.
	Modifying the clone does not affect the original array.
