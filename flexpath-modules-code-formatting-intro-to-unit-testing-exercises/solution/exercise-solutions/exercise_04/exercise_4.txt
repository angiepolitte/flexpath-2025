Exercise 4: Mixing ES Modules and CommonJS

Description: 

Explain why mixing ES Modules and CommonJS modules can lead to issues. 

Provide an example where importing a CommonJS module using 
ES Module syntax causes problems.


Answer:

Mixing ES Modules and CommonJS can lead to interoperability issues 
because they have different module resolution mechanisms. 

For example, trying to import a CommonJS module using ES Module 
import syntax may not provide the expected exports.

Look at the error that results from running `incorrectApp.js` in 
this directory.


To correctly import a CommonJS module in an ES Module, 
you may need to import the default export, as seen in the file `correctApp.js`
in this directory
