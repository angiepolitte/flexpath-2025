Exercise 5: Organizing Code into Separate Files

Description: Given a simple application (`app.js`) that calculates 
areas of shapes, separate the code into 3 separate modules: 

circle.js, rectangle.js, and main.js. 

Export the area calculation functions from each shape module and import 
them in main.js.
