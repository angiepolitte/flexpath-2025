Exercise 7: Managing Package Versions

Description: 

Explain the difference between installing a package 
with ^1.0.0, ~1.0.0, and 1.0.0 in the package.json dependencies. 

What do these version specifiers mean?


Answer:

^1.0.0: Allows all minor and patch updates. It matches versions >=1.0.0 <2.0.0.
~1.0.0: Allows only patch updates. It matches versions >=1.0.0 <1.1.0.
1.0.0: Locks the dependency to exactly version 1.0.0.
