Exercise 3: Understanding CommonJS Modules

Description: 

Create a module named stringUtils.cjs using CommonJS syntax 
that exports two functions: toUpperCase(str) and toLowerCase(str).

Then, import these functions in app.cjs using 
`require` and demonstrate their usage.


WARNING 

Notice that the file names above ends with .cjs instead of .js.

This current Github repo is configured, through the package.json file,
to use ES Module syntax as a default for all files.

To be able to use CommonJS syntax in a file, we just need to make the file 
extension .cjs instead of .js
