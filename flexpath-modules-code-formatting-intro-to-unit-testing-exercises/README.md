# flexpath-modules-code-formatting-intro-to-unit-testing-exercises

## Exercise overview

The intention of this exercise is to give you more experience working with
collections and loops in JavaScript.


## Getting Started


1. Using Visual Studio Code, open the folder `flexpath-modules-code-formatting-intro-to-unit-testing-exercises` 
   wherever you saved it on your device. 
2. Then open the `flexpath-modules-code-formatting-intro-to-unit-testing-exercises/exercises` folder. 
   Inside are a collection of folders for each exercise. Exercise instructions are 
   provided to you in .txt files in these folders.
3. To test your code, you will open up your terminal, and navigate to the specific `exercise_[number]`
   folder inside of the larger `exercises/` folder where you are working in, using the
   change directory command `cd`.
4. You will then run the command `node [filename].js` to run whichever file
   in the folder you are working with, replacing `[filename]` in the command
   with the file's actual name.


Exercise solutions are in the `/solution` folder
