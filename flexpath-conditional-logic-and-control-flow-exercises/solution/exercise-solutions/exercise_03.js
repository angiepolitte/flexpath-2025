    Exercise 3
    
    Conditionals

    1. Create a variable and store an even or odd number, your choice.
    2. Using the `%` (remainder) operator, write an if-else conditional
       that checks if a number is even. 
       
       If it is even, log "Even" to the console.
       If it is odd, log "Odd" to the console.
    
    3. Modify your initial variable code to assign a different number, 
       this time the opposite type (even or odd) than it was at first. 
       Run your code again and see how the result changes.
