    Logical Operators

    1. Create a variable named `color` that is assigned a color name as a string.
    2. Create an if-else conditional statement that checks if the `color`
       variable is either "red" or "blue". 

       If it is, log "Color is red or blue" to the console.
       If it is not, log "Color is not red or blue" to the console

       Reminder: The logical OR operator in JavaScript is `||`.
