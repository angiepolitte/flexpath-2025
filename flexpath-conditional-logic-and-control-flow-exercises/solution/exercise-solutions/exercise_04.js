    Exercise 4
    
    Logical Operators

    1. Create a variable and assign it a number between 10 and 20
    2. Write an if statement, using the >= (greater than or equal to), 
       <= (lesser than or equal to), and && (AND conditional) operators
       to check if this value is between 10 and 20.
       If it is, have the message "Between 10 and 20" be logged to the console.

    3. Modify your initial variable definition to be assigned a number 
       either less than 10 or greater than 20. Then run your conditional code 
       again. This time, nothing should log to the console.
