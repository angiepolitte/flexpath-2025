Exercise 14: Object Property Enumeration and Memory Reference

Problem:

Create an object `dataStore` that contains various data types as 
properties (numbers, strings, arrays, objects). 

Write a function `deepFreeze` that recursively freezes the object and 
all nested objects, preventing any modifications. 

Demonstrate that after freezing, properties cannot be changed, 
added, or deleted.
