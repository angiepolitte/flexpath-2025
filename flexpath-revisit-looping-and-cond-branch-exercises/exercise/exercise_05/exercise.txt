Exercise 5: Custom Increment/Decrement Operators

Problem:

Create an object `counter` with a property 'value' initialized to 0. 

Add methods 'increment' and 'decrement' that mimic the behavior of the 
increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. 

Ensure that the methods can be used in both prefix and postfix forms, and that 
they return the correct values.
