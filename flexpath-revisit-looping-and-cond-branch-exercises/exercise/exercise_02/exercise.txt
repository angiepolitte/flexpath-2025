Exercise 2: Nested Ternary Operators for Complex Decisions

Problem:

Create a function `calculateDiscount` that takes a customer's 
membershipLevel ('gold', 'silver', 'bronze', or 'none') and a purchaseAmount. 

The function should return the discount percentage based on the following:

- 'gold': 20%
- 'silver': 15%
- 'bronze': 10%
- 'none': 0%

Use nested ternary operators to implement this logic 
in a single return statement.
