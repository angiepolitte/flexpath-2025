Exercise 1: Complex Conditional Logic with Multiple Operators

Problem:

Write a function `validateUser` that accepts an object representing 
a user with properties 'age', 'isAdmin', and 'subscriptionType'. 

The function should return true if the user meets all the following conditions:

- The user is at least 18 years old.
- The user is an admin or has a subscription type of 'pro' or 'enterprise'.
- The user does not have a banned property set to true.

Implement the function using a combination of if-else statements, 
logical operators, and the !== operator for strict inequality.
