Exercise 11: Complex Conditional Logic in Loops

Problem:

Write a function `filterAndTransform` that takes an array of 
numbers and returns a new array where:

- All negative numbers are removed.
- All even numbers are squared.
- All odd numbers are incremented by 1.

Use for loops, if-else statements, and logical operators to 
implement this function.
