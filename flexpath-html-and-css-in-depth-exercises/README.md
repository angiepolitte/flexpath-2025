## Exercise overview

The intention of this exercise is to give you more experience creating HTML
files and styling them with CSS.

## Getting Started


1. Using Visual Studio Code, open the folder `flexpath-html-and-css-in-depth-exercises` 
   wherever you saved it on your device. 
2. Then open the `flexpath-html-and-css-in-depth-exercises/exercises` folder. 
   Inside are a collection of text files providing instructions for each exercise. 
   For each exercise, create a new folder for using the exercise_xx format,
   and create your html and css files inside of there
3. To test your code, you will just open your created .html files in your web browser
   and check that the rendered (displayed) contents meet the exercise requirements.
   We have provided you with a video `open-html-file-in-browser.mp4` showing how to do this.
   
   You will right click the file and select either "Reveal in Finder" (Mac) or
   "Open in File Explorer" (Windows). Then, right-click the .html file and 
   select "Open With". Then select your web browser to open the file.

VIDEO DISCLAIMER - You will need to clone the repo to your local device before
you can watch the .mp4 file since GitHub does not support watching it from here.
