<!> IMPORTANT MESSAGE BELOW <!>


Make sure you try to solve an exercise for 10-15 minutes before checking its solution.

If after that time you're still stumped, then don't worry! 
Reviewing the solution for an exercise is completely ok!

DON'T just copy the whole answer to your file and run it.
Instead, type out the answer by hand into your file. 

This way, you are tangibly interacting with the code from the answer, not just blindly pasting it in.
And, since typing out the answer code by hand is a more intentional action, you are more likely to 
remember the code you typed out!

Once you have typed out the answer and run it, mess with different parts of the answer to try to understand how
it works.

After doing this, try to answer the question on your own again.


This will feel like a slow process at first, but it is truly the FASTEST way to become a better programmer!
